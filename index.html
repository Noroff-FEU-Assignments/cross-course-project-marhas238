    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Using a server-side web framework, enabling HTTPS and using public available vulnerability scanner tools, including network security scanners. Remove or disable any markup that can contain instruction to run the code. Use of a two-factor authentication for login. Making every person involved in the development in some way responsible for security, SecDevOps makes security the first priority in software development and helps to eliminate security issues before they appear. Hire developers that know how to write a secure code, use automated security tools and scan for vulnerability while working on the code, because its easier to fix a code while youre working on it, rather than later. Performing security exercises called mock attacks is also a way to ensure web security, where you hire a team that continuously tries to challenge your security and establish a local team that is in charge of stopping such attempts.</p>
